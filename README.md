# androidApp

Math program

-Has been compiled/run in Android studio

Currently only a mobile app exists, no android tv app even though there's a folder for it.

Files that I wrote:

Java files are in androidApp/mobile/src/main/java/com/mathprog/sgrauerg/mathprog/

Layout files are in androidApp/mobile/src/main/res/layout/

Most of the other stuff is auto-generated
